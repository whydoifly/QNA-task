# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Next.js Project Dashboard application to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository (your current repository: `QNA-task`)
- GitHub Pages enabled on your repository
- Node.js and npm installed locally

## Configuration Changes Made

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)

- Added `output: 'export'` for static site generation
- Added `trailingSlash: true` for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Added `images: { unoptimized: true }` since GitHub Pages doesn't support Next.js Image Optimization
- Added `basePath` and `assetPrefix` for proper routing on GitHub Pages

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

- Automated build and deployment process
- Runs tests before deployment
- Builds the application for production
- Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically

### 3. Package.json Scripts

- Added `export` script for manual static export

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### Step 2: Push Your Changes

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. You should see a workflow run called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Click on it to monitor the deployment progress
4. The deployment will:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run tests
   - Build the application
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 4: Access Your Application

Once the deployment is complete, your application will be available at:

```
https://[your-username].github.io/QNA-task/
```

Replace `[your-username]` with your actual GitHub username.

## Local Testing

To test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# The static files will be generated in the 'out' directory
# You can serve them using any static file server, for example:
npx serve out
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 Errors on Refresh**

   - This is normal for single-page applications on GitHub Pages
   - The application uses client-side routing

2. **Images Not Loading**

   - Make sure all images are in the `public` folder
   - Use relative paths for images

3. **Build Failures**

   - Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
   - Ensure all tests pass before deployment

4. **Styling Issues**
   - Verify that Tailwind CSS is properly configured
   - Check that all CSS files are being included

### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# Build and export
npm run build

# The 'out' directory contains your static site
# You can upload this to any static hosting service
```

## Environment Variables

If you need environment variables for production:

1. Go to your repository **Settings**
2. Click on **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Add your environment variables as repository secrets
4. Update the workflow file to use these secrets

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `public` folder with your domain
2. Configure your domain's DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages
3. Enable the custom domain in your repository's Pages settings

## Updating Your Application

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch, the application will automatically redeploy. The deployment process typically takes 2-5 minutes.

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that all configuration files are correct
3. Ensure your application builds successfully locally with `npm run build`

Your Project Dashboard is now ready for deployment to GitHub Pages! ðŸš€

## Quick Troubleshooting

If you see "Site not found":

1. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings â†’ Pages
2. Verify the source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Check the Actions tab for deployment status
4. Use the correct URL: `https://[username].github.io/QNA-task/`
